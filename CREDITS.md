## Credits

- [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org) and - [IronPython Team](http://ironpython.net) for creating and maintaining such a powerful language.
- [Jetbrains PyCharm Team](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) for the best IDE ever and support of open-source projects! PyCharm is a python IDE but is truly the best I have ever worked with. Jetbrains team truely knows how to make effective and user friendly software. Jetbrains provides free license to their pyCharm IDE for open-source projects and that's how I got to use pyCharm for pyRevit development. I ended up using Atom.io more as my main text editor but had a great time using pyCharm for may years.
- [Daren Thomas](https://github.com/daren-thomas) (original version, maintainer of [RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell)) for creating RPS and helping me.
