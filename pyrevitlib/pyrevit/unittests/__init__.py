"""The main pyRevit test is the startup test which is done by launching Revit.

This module is created to provide a platform to perform complete tests on
different components of pyRevit.
For example, as the git module grows, new tests will be added to the git test
suite to test the full functionality of that module, although only a subset of
functions are used during startup and normal operations of pyRevit.
